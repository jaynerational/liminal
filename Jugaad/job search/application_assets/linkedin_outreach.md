## 2. The Referral Request (Warm)

## 3. The Cold Outreach (High-Leverage)
"Hi [Hiring Manager], I'm Jayaditya. I specialize in ROI-first operations. I recently delivered 838% ROI at AB InBev and raised $125k for my last venture. I see you're scaling [Product/Team]—I'd love to chat about how I can help enable similar revenue deltas for your team."
