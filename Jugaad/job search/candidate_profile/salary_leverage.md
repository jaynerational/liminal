# Salary Leverage Justification

## Targeted Range: ₹18 - 30 LPA

### 1. ROI-Based Valuation
- **Metric**: Delivered 838% ROI at AB InBev.
- **Justification**: My cost to the company is a fraction of the value captured. I don't just 'manage' roles; I 'optimize' them for maximum financial delta.

### 2. Revenue Enablement
- **Metric**: $928k in revenue enablement.
- **Justification**: At a mid-to-senior level, my ability to unlock nearly $1M in revenue justifies a top-tier base salary in any competitive market.

### 3. High-Stakes Competency
- **Metric**: $125k fundraising and CAT 99.2 percentile.
- **Justification**: These signals represent a high floor for cognitive ability and the capability to operate under pressure in high-stakes environments (VC, Strategy, Leadership).

### 4. Market Positioning
- Positioned against Tier-1 MBA/Engineering graduates who typically command this range, but with the added "skin in the game" from entrepreneurial experience.
